# Algorithms And DataStructures 
A repository that contains a selection of problem solved during the preparation of several Online and Onsite Problem solving competitions, Mainly:
- Google CodeJam 
- Google kickstart
- Google Hashcode
- IEEE xtreem 
- ACM TCPC/ACPC

The Problems are grouped by category for future references, however the same problem have more then one category at a time and the choice of the main category was taken on a personal estimation and on classification of my best reference book, [Competitive Programming 3](https://cpbook.net/).

Those problems are mainly taken from Codeforces.com,Hackerrank.com and UVA online judge.

Recently, I keep the solutions on the platforms themselves and they started recently to offer the possibility to maintain the code accessible and editble after it submision:

- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/Ha_Nabil)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/geekhamza)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/geekhamza/)


Note: Some of the problems are not 100% finished so feel free to add your personal solutions.
